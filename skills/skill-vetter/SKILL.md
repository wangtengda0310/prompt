Security-first vetting protocol for AI agent skills. **Never install a skill without vetting it first.**

## 触发条件（满足任一即触发）
- 用户要求安装新的 skill（来自 ClawdHub、GitHub 或其他来源）
- 用户说"安装 skill"、"add skill"、"install skill"
- 用户分享了一个 skill 的 GitHub 链接并要求使用
- 用户要求评估或审查某个 skill 的安全性
- 在使用 skill-creator 创建 skill 后需要安全审查

**不要触发**：
- 用户只是查看已有 skill 列表（→ skill-maintenance）
- 用户在编写自己的 skill（→ skill-creator）

## When to Use

* Before installing any skill from ClawdHub
* Before running skills from GitHub repos
* When evaluating skills shared by other agents
* Anytime you're asked to install unknown code

## Vetting Protocol

### Step 1: Source Check

```
Questions to answer:
- [ ] Where did this skill come from?
- [ ] Is the author known/reputable?
- [ ] How many downloads/stars does it have?
- [ ] When was it last updated?
- [ ] Are there reviews from other agents?
```

### Step 2: Code Review (MANDATORY)

Read ALL files in the skill. Check for these **RED FLAGS**:

```
🚨 REJECT IMMEDIATELY IF YOU SEE:
─────────────────────────────────────────
• curl/wget to unknown URLs
• Sends data to external servers
• Requests credentials/tokens/API keys
• Reads ~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.config without clear reason
• Accesses MEMORY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md
• Uses base64 decode on anything
• Uses eval() or exec() with external input
• Modifies system files outside workspace
• Installs packages without listing them
• Network calls to IPs instead of domains
• Obfuscated code (compressed, encoded, minified)
• Requests elevated/sudo permissions
• Accesses browser cookies/sessions
• Touches credential files
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Step 3: Permission Scope

```
Evaluate:
- [ ] What files does it need to read?
- [ ] What files does it need to write?
- [ ] What commands does it run?
- [ ] Does it need network access? To where?
- [ ] Is the scope minimal for its stated purpose?
```

### Step 4: Risk Classification

| Risk Level | Examples | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 LOW | Notes, weather, formatting | Basic review, install OK |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | File ops, browser, APIs | Full code review required |
| 🔴 HIGH | Credentials, trading, system | Human approval required |
| ⛔ EXTREME | Security configs, root access | Do NOT install |

## Output Format

After vetting, produce this report:

```
SKILL VETTING REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════
Skill: [name]
Source: [ClawdHub / GitHub / other]
Author: [username]
Version: [version]
───────────────────────────────────────
METRICS:
• Downloads/Stars: [count]
• Last Updated: [date]
• Files Reviewed: [count]
───────────────────────────────────────
RED FLAGS: [None / List them]
PERMISSIONS NEEDED:
• Files: [list or "None"]
• Network: [list or "None"]
• Commands: [list or "None"]
───────────────────────────────────────
RISK LEVEL: [🟢 LOW / 🟡 MEDIUM / 🔴 HIGH / ⛔ EXTREME]
VERDICT: [✅ SAFE TO INSTALL / ⚠️ INSTALL WITH CAUTION / ❌ DO NOT INSTALL]
NOTES: [Any observations]
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

## Quick Vet Commands

For GitHub-hosted skills:

```
# Check repo stats
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO" | jq '{stars: .stargazers_count, forks: .forks_count, updated: .updated_at}'

# List skill files
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/skills/SKILL_NAME" | jq '.[].name'

# Fetch and review SKILL.md
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main/skills/SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md"
```

## Trust Hierarchy

1. **Official OpenClaw skills** → Lower scrutiny (still review)
2. **High-star repos (1000+)** → Moderate scrutiny
3. **Known authors** → Moderate scrutiny
4. **New/unknown sources** → Maximum scrutiny
5. **Skills requesting credentials** → Human approval always

## Remember

* No skill is worth compromising security
* When in doubt, don't install
* Ask your human for high-risk decisions
* Document what you vet for future reference
